Plan for tag testing experiment 1
written: 11 Feb 2013

Preparation for experiments:
- Only use tags with ID 39xxx for experiments (37xxx tags have different ping rate)
- Only set up one channel to listen for pings (e.g. channel 1), is seems from pilot experiment that channels may interfere.
- Give test locations a name (e.g. Ho'okele, or red raft) and note GPS coordinates (can be done using the VR100).
- Make sure VR100 time is set correctly (to local time).
- Record background noise by putting hydrophone in water for a few minutes and note the range of the noise level (e.g 30-34 dB). Keep an eye on the background noise during experiments and note if significant changes occur.


Plan:
-- A. Test of tag container cases
- 1. Approx 1 m from hydrophone, 1 hour, four tags in mesh bag:
Tag 39193 no case
Tag 39194 small case no holes
Tag 39195 small case with holes
Tag 39196 large case
- 2. Shake the mesh bag so the tags are randomly shuffled around inside it and put back in water for 1 hour at same depth and location as above. (this is to check if tag orientation might play a role for signal strength etc.)

-- B. Test of tag interference (collisions)
- 1. Approx 1 m from hydrophone, 1 hour, four tags in mesh bag (no cases):
Tag 39193 
Tag 39194 
Tag 39195 
Tag 39196 
- 2. Approx 1 m from hydrophone, 1 hour, eight tags in mesh bag (no cases):
Tag 39189
Tag 39190
Tag 39191
Tag 39192
Tag 39193
Tag 39194
Tag 39195
Tag 39196
- 3. If time allows repeat with 16 tags (only use tags with ID 39xxx [not 37xxx])
