Ideas on how to analyse the Diamondhead ranging data - 04.02.2013

- Check for temporal variability e.g. by FFT or see if autocorrelation function is significant at any lags.

- If temporal variability is not present all data points from a receiver/transmitter combination can be assumed to be independent. One could then construct a GLM for the proportion of received transmissions with depth of receiver, depth of transmitter, and distance  as factors.

- Pairwise tests to check differences in proportion of received pings

- Cross-correlations 

- Multivariate time series analysis?

- If temporal variability is present subsample the time series?
